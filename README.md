Description/Purpose: For this project, I have continued work on my first project for this course. I went back and added some of the future additions that I listed in the "Future Work" section for the original project. I added in email verification for registration and an order page. The order page is not yet fully functional. There are some issues in the works with it. In addition to those two items, I also added in a contact page for registered users. There, they can send a message to the owners of the resaurant. Any message sent from that page goes to a data table, and a email notification will inform you that the message was successful. I also added in email notification for reviews being inputted. To do notifications for the review and contact pages, I had to some code to the log-in function so that the variable "$_SESSION['email]'"_ was created.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server.

Usage: This project can be used to view a restaurant webpage and use some of its functionalities.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to get the order page fully functional, and I would also like to add in a
transaction page, where payments for takeout orders will be processed. Another addition I would like to make is an admin portion of the site, where you add or take away items from the data table with the items and also change the prices on them.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
