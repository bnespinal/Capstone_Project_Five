Description/Purpose: For this project, I have continued work on an HTML project, creating a restaurant webpage, 
and made it into a functioning webpage with access to data tables created in phpmyadmin. Among its functionality,
users of this webpage are able to register as a user and log into the site to be able to have access to additional
pages and functions only logged in users can see.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server.

Usage: This project can be used to view a restaurant webpage and use some of its functionalities.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to get the order page fully functional, and I would also like to add in a
transaction page, where payments for takeout orders will be processed. Another addition I would like to make is an admin portion of the site, where you add or take away items from the data table with the items and also change the prices on them.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
