<p id="statement">This website is a revision of my first capstone project for the course CSCI 495. Here I am demonstrating<br> acquired skills from the Information Systems field in use
to create a webpage using HTML, MYSQL, and PHP languages.<br> Last time I worked on this project, some of the future additions I said I wanted to work on where email verification, and an order<br> page.
I managed the email verification, and added a partially functional order page. I also added in email verification for<br> inputting a review, and a page where you can send a survey to the restaurant owners.</p>
